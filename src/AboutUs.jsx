          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Rice N' Shine is an online project by a team of Filipino students
            who share a common interest in food, culture, and accessibility. The
            project aims to provide an accessible and systematic online site
            with recipes from all over the Philippines, including cultural
            background, simple steps, and variety of regions. The website seeks
            to cater to both novice and seasoned home cooks—be they Filipinos
            who want to get back to their roots, or non-Filipinos who want to
            discover the nation's food.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team chose to pursue this project because we saw an increasing
            disconnect between contemporary Filipino youth and traditional
            culinary culture. With recipes frequently shared orally within
            families, there is little centralized, consistent, and culturally
            sensitive information online. By constructing Rice N' Shine, we aim
            to make a contribution toward the preservation and sharing of
            Filipino food culture in an educational yet entertaining manner.
